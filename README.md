# wikiversity-2013

The material in this repository was published before on German Wikiversity and on Wikimedia Commons. The text and the presentation were produced in the run-up to the first (and, hitherto, only) meeting of users interested in German Wikiversity which took place in 2013 at Limburg an der Lahn, Germany. 

In June 2013 I wrote an essay on the prospect for Wikiversity within the German education and media landscape. At the meeting I gave an introduction to start the conversation, outlining the development of the project and our plans for the future at the time.
